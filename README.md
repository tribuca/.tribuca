Tribuca unprecedented Metaverse

We care about the nature and its ecosystem!

At Tribuca, we believe one of the biggest challenges to overcome collectively for the future of our planet is the soil erosion.

Our metaverse, Tribuca, is built to reflect the root causes of this challenge; improper farming practices based on mercenary greed as a result of population growth. The soil erosion causes us to face many problems including but not limited to food security, climate change and even global warming.

We aim to raise awareness on the current issues our planet faces environmentally, while bringing nature, agronomy management and good agricultural practices to everyday lives of our users.

We design autonomous and intelligent NFTâ€™s enriched by AI, based on Ontology, powered by System Dynamics, interacting by Agent-Based Modeling, sustained by Complexity Theory.

TRIBUCA ensures decentralized interoperability, openness, self-sovereignty, individual storage, non-manipulation messaging, secure payment, seamless gateways, and natural language search & discovery, which can only be achieved via blockchain capabilities.

You are invited to a splendid playground that is our planet.
